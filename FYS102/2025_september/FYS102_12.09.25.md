# Physics 102 - Lecture on Kinematics: Motion and Displacement

## Kort sammendrag
This lecture introduces fundamental concepts of kinematics, focusing on the motion of point-like objects. The discussion covers key definitions such as position, displacement, velocity, speed, and acceleration. The lecture emphasizes the importance of choosing appropriate coordinate systems and understanding the difference between scalar quantities (like speed) and vector quantities (like velocity). The goal is to provide a mathematical framework for describing motion without considering the forces causing it.

## Nøkkelbegreper
- **Kinematics:** Study of motion without considering forces
- **Point-like object:** An object whose size is negligible for measurement purposes
- **Position vector:** Describes an object's location relative to a reference point
- **Displacement:** Vector representing the change in position between two points
- **Velocity:** Vector describing the rate and direction of motion
- **Speed:** Scalar magnitude of velocity

## Viktige påstander/teoremer/formler

### Position and Displacement
- Position vector $\vec{r}(t)$ describes object location at time $t$
- Displacement $\Delta\vec{r} = \vec{r}_2 - \vec{r}_1$ between times $t_1$ and $t_2$

### Velocity
- Average velocity: $\vec{v}_{\text{avg}} = \frac{\Delta\vec{r}}{\Delta t}$
- Instantaneous velocity: $\vec{v} = \lim_{\Delta t \to 0} \frac{\Delta\vec{r}}{\Delta t} = \frac{d\vec{r}}{dt}$
- Velocity is tangent to the trajectory in the limit

### Speed
- Average speed: $s_{\text{avg}} = \frac{\Delta k}{\Delta t}$
- Instantaneous speed: $s = \frac{d k}{dt}$
- Speed is the magnitude of velocity: $s = |\vec{v}|$

### Acceleration
- Average acceleration: $\vec{a}_{\text{avg}} = \frac{\vec{v}_2 - \vec{v}_1}{t_2 - t_1}$
- Instantaneous acceleration: $\vec{a} = \frac{d\vec{v}}{dt} = \frac{d^2\vec{r}}{dt^2}$

## Eksempler og typiske feil

### Example: Motion with Constant Velocity
- Choose coordinate system aligned with velocity
- Set initial position at origin
- Velocity remains constant
- Position changes linearly with time

### Common Mistakes
- Confusing speed and velocity
- Neglecting vector nature of displacement and velocity
- Incorrect unit conversions
- Not considering the limit process in instantaneous quantities

## Forutsetninger og antakelser
- Object treated as a point-like body
- Coordinate system and time can be arbitrarily chosen
- Physical observables must be independent of coordinate system choice

## Metoder/oppskrifter
1. Define coordinate system
2. Choose initial time and position
3. Use calculus to relate position, velocity, and acceleration
4. Apply chain rule and integration techniques

## Cornell-spørsmål

# FYS102 - Lecture on Constant Velocity Motion

## Short Summary
This lecture explores the fundamental principles of motion with constant velocity, focusing on how to mathematically describe the position, velocity, and acceleration of an object moving in a straight line. The key insights include understanding the difference between speed and velocity, deriving position equations using calculus, and demonstrating how constant velocity implies motion along a straight line. The lecture emphasizes the importance of choosing appropriate coordinate systems and initial conditions to solve motion problems.

## Key Concepts
- **Velocity vs. Speed**: 
  - Velocity is a vector with magnitude and direction
  - Speed is the magnitude of velocity
  - Constant speed does not imply constant velocity (e.g., circular motion)

- **Constant Velocity Motion**:
  - Acceleration is zero
  - Position changes linearly with time
  - Motion occurs along a straight line

- **Position Equation**:
  - $\vec{r}(t) = \vec{v}(t - t_0) + \vec{r}_0$
  - Depends on initial position, velocity, and time

## Important Formulas
- **Velocity**: $\vec{v} = \frac{d\vec{r}}{dt}$
- **Acceleration**: $\vec{a} = \frac{d\vec{v}}{dt} = 0$ (for constant velocity)
- **Position**: $\vec{r}(t) = \vec{v}(t - t_0) + \vec{r}_0$

## Examples and Common Mistakes
1. **Circular Motion Example**:
   - Constant speed does not mean constant velocity
   - Direction changes, causing non-zero acceleration

2. **Coordinate System Selection**:
   - Choose a system that simplifies calculations
   - Initial position at origin often helps

3. **Typical Errors**:
   - Confusing speed with velocity
   - Neglecting vector nature of motion
   - Incorrect handling of integration constants

## Assumptions and Conditions
- Point-like object approximation
- Straight-line motion
- Constant velocity vector
- No external forces

## Trajectory Determination
- Trajectory is the set of points object passes through
- For constant velocity: straight line
- Equation: $y = \alpha x + \beta$

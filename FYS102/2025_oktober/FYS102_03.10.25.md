# Physics (FYS102) - Lecture: Motion with Constant Acceleration

## Short Summary
This lecture covered motion with constant acceleration, focusing on cases where acceleration is parallel to velocity. The professor derived equations for position and velocity as functions of time, starting from basic definitions and using integration. The lecture emphasized the importance of choosing appropriate reference frames and demonstrated how to analyze trajectories. A significant portion also addressed student feedback about the course structure and teaching methods.

## Key Concepts
- **Constant Acceleration Motion**
  - Acceleration parallel to velocity
  - Position and velocity as functions of time
  - Choice of reference frame importance
- **Mathematical Tools**
  - Integration of acceleration to get velocity
  - Integration of velocity to get position
  - Boundary conditions application

## Important Equations
1. **Velocity as function of time (simplified case)**
   $$v_x(t) = v_{0x} + a_xt$$

2. **Position as function of time (simplified case)**
   $$r_x(t) = v_{0x}t + \frac{1}{2}a_xt^2$$

3. **General case (with arbitrary initial time $t_0$)**
   $$r(t) = \begin{pmatrix} r_{x0} + v_{x0}(t-t_0) + \frac{1}{2}a_x(t-t_0)^2 \\ r_{y0} + v_{y0}(t-t_0) + \frac{1}{2}a_y(t-t_0)^2 \end{pmatrix}$$

## Example Problem

# Physics - Lecture: Motion with Constant Acceleration & Circular Motion

## Short Summary
This lecture covered two main topics: motion with constant acceleration (not necessarily parallel to initial velocity) and an introduction to circular motion. For constant acceleration, the lecture derived expressions for position and velocity components, showing that the resulting trajectory is parabolic. The lecture then introduced circular motion concepts including polar coordinates and angular quantities (velocity and acceleration).

## Key Concepts

### Constant Acceleration Motion
- Position components:
  - $x(t) = v_{0x}t + x_0$
  - $y(t) = \frac{1}{2}a_yt^2 + v_{0y}t + y_0$
- Trajectory equation:
  - $y(x) = -\frac{g}{2v_0^2\cos^2\theta_0}x^2 + (\tan\theta_0)x$
- Range formula:
  - $R = \frac{v_0^2\sin(2\theta_0)}{g}$

### Circular Motion
- Position in polar coordinates:
  - $x = r_0\cos(\theta)$
  - $y = r_0\sin(\theta)$
- Angular quantities:
  - Average angular velocity: $\omega_{avg} = \frac{\theta_2 - \theta_1}{t_2 - t_1}$
  - Instantaneous angular velocity: $\omega = \frac{d\theta}{dt}$
  - Average angular acceleration: $\alpha_{avg} = \frac{\omega_2 - \omega_1}{t_2 - t_1}$
  - Instantaneous angular acceleration: $\alpha = \frac{d\omega}{dt}$

## Important Theorems/Results
1. For constant acceleration not parallel to initial velocity:
   - Motion splits into constant velocity (x-direction) and accelerated motion (y-direction)
   - Trajectory is parabolic
2. For uniform circular motion:
   - Angular velocity is constant ($\theta = \omega t$)
   - Motion requires centripetal acceleration

## Examples
### Projectile Motion Problem
Given:
- Initial velocity: 5 m/s
- Acceleration: g = 9.81 m/sÂ²
Task: Find
1. Distance where ball touches ground
2. Maximum height reached

## Prerequisites
- Vector components
- Basic trigonometry
- Differentiation and integration
- Newton's laws of motion

## Methods/Procedures
1. For projectile motion:
   - Choose coordinate system (typically y-axis opposite to g)
   - Decompose initial velocity into components
   - Apply constant acceleration equations
   - Find landing point using y(x) = 0
   - Find maximum height using dy/dx = 0

2. For circular motion:
   - Convert between polar and Cartesian coordinates
   - Use angular quantities for rotational analysis

## Review Questions
1. Why is the trajectory parabolic for projectile motion?
2. How do you find the maximum height in projectile motion?
3. What is the difference between average and instantaneous angular velocity?
4. Why do we often convert from polar to Cartesian coordinates?

## Open Questions
1. How does air resistance modify these results?
2. What happens when acceleration is not constant?

# Chemistry Lecture: Acids and Bases - Chapter 8

## Short Summary
This lecture covered fundamental concepts of acid-base chemistry, introducing two major definitions: Arrhenius and Brønsted. The lecture explained the differences between strong and weak acids/bases, introduced pH and pOH concepts, and covered autoprotolysis of water. Key topics included conjugate acid-base pairs and amphoteric substances.

## Key Definitions

### Acid Definitions
- **Arrhenius Acid:** A substance that contains hydrogen and increases H3O+ concentration in water
- **Brønsted Acid:** A substance that gives away a proton (H+)
- **Strong Acid:** Reacts completely with water to form H3O+
- **Weak Acid:** Reacts only partially with water to form H3O+

### Base Definitions
- **Arrhenius Base:** A substance that increases OH- concentration in water
- **Brønsted Base:** A substance that accepts a proton
- **Strong Base:** Metal hydroxides that completely separate into metal ions and OH- in water
- **Weak Base:** Reacts only partially with water to form OH-

## Important Concepts

### Autoprotolysis of Water
- Self-ionization of water: H2O + H2O ⇌ H3O+ + OH-
- At 25°C: Kw = [H3O+][OH-] = 1.0 × 10^-14

### pH and pOH
- pH = -log[H3O+]
- pOH = -log[OH-]
- pH + pOH = 14 (at 25°C)

### Important Strong Acids to Remember
1. HCl (Hydrochloric acid)
2. HBr (Hydrobromic acid)
3. HI (Hydroiodic acid)
4. HNO3 (Nitric acid)
5. H2SO4 (Sulfuric acid)

### Important Strong Bases to Remember
1. LiOH (Lithium hydroxide)
2. NaOH (Sodium hydroxide)
3. KOH (Potassium hydroxide)
4. CsOH (Cesium hydroxide)
5. Ba(OH)2 (Barium hydroxide)
6. Ca(OH)2 (Calcium hydroxide)

## Examples

### Strong Acid Example
HCl + H2O → H3O+ + Cl-
- Initial: 1M HCl
- Equilibrium: Complete conversion to products

### Weak Acid Example
CH3COOH + H2O ⇌ H3O+ + CH3COO-
- Initial: 1M CH3COOH
- Equilibrium: ~99% remains as CH3COOH, only ~1% reacts

## Practice Problems

### pH Calculation Example
Given: 0.001M HNO3 (strong acid)
Solution:
1. HNO3 completely dissociates
2. [H3O+] = 0.001M
3. pH = -log(0.001) = 3

### pOH/pH Calculation Example
Given: 0.005M Ca(OH)2 solution
Solution:
1. Ca(OH)2 → Ca2+ + 2OH-
2. [OH-] = 0.01M
3. pOH = -log(0.01) = 2
4. pH = 14 - pOH = 12

## Common Student Mistakes
- Forgetting that strong acids/bases react completely
- Not accounting for stoichiometry in hydroxide dissociation
- Confusing Arrhenius and Brønsted definitions
- Not recognizing amphoteric substances (like water)

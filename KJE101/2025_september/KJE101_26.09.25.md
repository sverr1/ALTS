# KJE101 - Lecture: Chemical Equilibrium

## Short Summary
This lecture covered chemical equilibrium, focusing on how reactions reach equilibrium and Le Chatelier's principle. Key concepts included the collision theory, equilibrium constants, and how reactions respond to disturbances. The lecture emphasized that while equilibrium constants remain fixed for a given reaction, concentrations can vary at different equilibrium states.

## Key Concepts

### Collision Theory
- Molecules must collide to react
- Fundamental basis for understanding reaction kinetics
- Collisions must have sufficient energy for reaction to occur

### Chemical Equilibrium
- Final destination of chemical reactions
- Forward and reverse reaction rates are equal
- Concentrations stop changing once equilibrium is reached
- Expressed through equilibrium constant (Kc)

### Equilibrium Constant (Kc)
- Ratio of product to reactant concentrations at equilibrium
- No units
- Always constant for a specific reaction at given temperature
- Formula: $K_c = \frac{[Products]^{stoich.coeff.}}{[Reactants]^{stoich.coeff.}}$

### Le Chatelier's Principle
Reactions respond to disturbances by:
1. Concentration changes:
   - Adding product → Reaction shifts backward
   - Adding reactant → Reaction shifts forward
2. Volume changes:
   - Increasing volume → Favors more gas molecules
   - Decreasing volume → Favors fewer gas molecules
   - No effect if equal molecules on both sides

## Important Examples

### N₂O₄ ⇌ 2NO₂ Equilibrium
- Demonstrates how reactions reach equilibrium
- Shows concentration changes over time
- Illustrates equal forward/reverse rates at equilibrium

### H₂ + I₂ ⇌ 2HI Example
- Equilibrium constant = 54
- Shows how different concentration combinations can give same Kc
- Demonstrates concentration calculations at equilibrium

## Common Mistakes to Avoid
- Including units in Kc calculations
- Assuming Kc changes with different equilibrium conditions
- Ignoring stoichiometric coefficients in calculations
- Accepting negative concentration solutions in equilibrium problems

## Practice Questions
1. What determines if a reaction has reached equilibrium?
2. How does Le Chatelier's principle predict reaction behavior?
3. Why doesn't Kc have units?
4. How do volume changes affect equilibrium for reactions with equal moles of gas on both sides?
5. What role does collision theory play in reaching equilibrium?

## Key Formulas
$K_c = \frac{[Products]^{stoich.coeff.}}{[Reactants]^{stoich.coeff.}}$

For example, for N₂ + 3H₂ ⇌ 2NH₃:
$K_c = \frac{[NH_3]^2}{[N_2][H_2]^3}$

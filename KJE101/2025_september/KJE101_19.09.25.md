# Physics 102 - Lecture 6: Introduction to Gases

## Short Summary
This lecture introduces the fundamental properties of gases, focusing on the behavior of gas particles and the ideal gas law. The discussion covers four key properties of gases: pressure, volume, temperature, and amount of substance. The lecture explains how these properties interact, introduces the concept of collision theory, and explores factors affecting chemical reaction rates.

## Key Concepts
- Gas particles: Constantly moving in random directions
- Pressure: Force exerted by gas particles colliding with container walls
- Volume: Equal to the container's volume
- Temperature: Measure of particle motion/kinetic energy
- Ideal Gas Law: $PV = nRT$

## Important Formulas and Laws
- Ideal Gas Law: $PV = nRT$
  - $P$: Pressure (Pascal)
  - $V$: Volume (m³)
  - $n$: Amount of substance (moles)
  - $R$: Gas constant (8.31 J/mol·K)
  - $T$: Temperature (Kelvin)

- Avogadro's Law: $\frac{V_1}{n_1} = \frac{V_2}{n_2}$ (at constant temperature and pressure)

- Molar Concentration: $C = \frac{n}{V}$

## Examples and Common Mistakes
1. **Temperature Conversion**
   - Always convert Celsius to Kelvin: $T_{K} = T_{°C} + 273.15$
   - Mistake: Forgetting to convert temperature units

2. **Gas Constant Variations**
   - Multiple versions with different units
   - Always match units consistently in calculations

## Assumptions and Conditions
- Ideal Gas Law assumes:
  - Negligible molecular volume
  - No intermolecular forces
  - Perfectly elastic collisions
- Standard Temperature and Pressure (STP):
  - Temperature: 0°C (273.15 K)
  - Pressure: 1 atmosphere
  - Standard Molar Volume: 22.4 L/mol

## Collision Theory
- Molecules must collide to react
- Activation Energy: Minimum kinetic energy required for reaction
- Reaction rate increases with:
  - Higher concentration
  - Higher temperature
  - More frequent molecular collisions

## Cornell Questions
1. How does temperature affect gas particle motion?
2. What determines the pressure of a gas in a container?
3. Why do smaller volumes lead to higher gas pressures?
4. How does concentration impact reaction rates?
5. What is activation energy, and why is it important?

## Open Questions/Uncertainties
- Precise molecular interactions in real gases
- Limitations of the ideal gas approximation
- Quantum mechanical effects at extreme conditions

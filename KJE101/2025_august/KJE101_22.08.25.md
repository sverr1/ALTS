# KJE101 - Fundamental Chemistry: Introduction to Atomic Structure and Chemical Formulas

## Kort sammendrag
This introductory lecture covers fundamental concepts in chemistry, focusing on atomic structure, the periodic table, chemical formulas, and basic chemical calculations. The lecture explores the composition of atoms, isotopes, chemical nomenclature, reaction balancing, and the concept of moles. Key topics include subatomic particles, chemical formula writing rules, balanced reaction equations, and converting between different chemical representations.

## Nøkkelbegreper
- **Atom:** Smallest particle constituting an element, containing protons, neutrons, and electrons
- **Isotope:** Atoms of the same element with different numbers of neutrons
- **Chemical Formula:** Describes elements present in a substance and their atomic ratios
- **Mole:** Unit measuring the number of particles in a sample (6.022 × 10²³ particles)
- **Avogadro's Constant:** 6.022 × 10²³ particles per mole

## Viktige påstander/teoremer/formler

### Atom Composition
- **Proton (P⁺):** Positive charge (+1)
- **Electron (e⁻):** Negative charge (-1)
- **Neutron (N):** Neutral charge (0)
- **Atom Identity:** Determined by number of protons

### Chemical Formula Rules
1. Atom most right in periodic table written first
2. For atoms in same group, element lower in table written first
3. Exceptions exist for specific compounds

### Mole Calculations
- **Number of Moles:** $n = \frac{\text{Number of Particles}}{\text{Avogadro's Constant}}$
- **Molar Mass:** Mass of substance per mole (g/mol)
- **Moles to Grams:** $n = \frac{\text{Mass}}{\text{Molar Mass}}$

## Eksempler og typiske feil

### Balancing Chemical Reactions
**Example:** Balancing propane combustion
- Start by balancing one atom type at a time
- Use stoichiometric coefficients
- Ensure equal atoms on both sides of reaction

### Common Mistakes
- Incorrectly writing chemical formulas
- Failing to balance chemical reactions
- Misunderstanding mole conversions

## Forutsetninger og antakelser
- Bohr's atomic model as an approximate atomic description
- Atoms seek lowest possible energy configuration
- Electrons distributed in orbits with maximum capacity

## Metoder/oppskrifter

### Balancing Reactions
1. Choose an atom to balance first
2. Add stoichiometric coefficients
3. Verify equal atoms on both sides
4. Check each atom type systematically

### Mole Calculations
1. Identify number of particles
2. Use Avogadro's constant
3. Convert between moles, particles, and mass
